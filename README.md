# Turtle-Crossing-Game

The object of this game is to get your "turtle" from the south side of the board to the north side of the board without getting hit by the "cars" moving east to west.  Once you get to the top of the board, the turtle is reset back to the bottom of the board and the level is increased by 1.  As the levels increase, the cars start moving faster.

I used the Turtle library in Python to design this game.  Enjoy!
